# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project identity

Package name is `tokn-on-sol` (legacy). The product is branded **Passly** throughout the UI. Use "Passly" for all user-facing copy, component names, and docs. Don't rename the package.

## Verification workflow

Don't run the dev server or build. Verify changes with:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # type-check
npm run lint       # ESLint (Next.js recommended + TypeScript strict)
npm test           # Vitest — payout fee/hold/idempotency unit tests
```

The user pushes to git and checks Vercel deploys manually.

```bash
npm run create-tree  # One-time: deploy a Merkle tree to Solana devnet
```

## Architecture

Passly is a Next.js 16 App Router application for minting Solana compressed NFT (cNFT) tickets. Buyers pay via Stripe (EUR); a Stripe webhook mints the ticket on-chain. Doormen scan QR codes to verify and redeem tickets.

### Key flows

1. **Purchase** – `/shop/[id]` → `/api/checkout/create` (reserves capacity atomically via `reserve_tickets` SQL function, then creates a 30-min Stripe session) → Stripe webhook `/api/webhooks/stripe` converts the reservation to a sale (`finalize_ticket_sale`), enqueues a `mint_jobs` row and returns immediately. Minting runs async: `after()` in the webhook invocation processes the job (`src/lib/mintJobs.ts`); `/api/checkout/confirm` (polled by the success page) kicks the worker again when tickets are missing, and the daily cron `/api/cron/mint` is the final safety net (Vercel Hobby plan — sub-daily crons are not allowed). Max 5 attempts with 2-min backoff, then status `failed` → auto-refund of the unminted share (`autoRefundFailedJob`; skipped when the payout was already transferred or is disputed) + admin alert email with the refund outcome. `checkout.session.expired` releases the reservation; `release_expired_reservations()` in the payout cron is the safety net for missed expiry webhooks.
2. **QR verification** – `src/app/tickets/[assetId]/TicketClient.tsx` generates a QR code by signing a challenge with the buyer's embedded Solana wallet (Ed25519). Doorman page (`/doorman/[eventId]`) scans it with jsQR and calls `/api/tickets/verify`.
   - Token format: compact JSON `{ a: assetId, t: minuteTimestamp, w: walletAddress, s: base58Signature }`
   - Challenge signed by the wallet: `` `passly:verify:${assetId}:${t}` `` where `t = Math.floor(Date.now() / 60000)`
   - The doorman POSTs `{ token, eventId }` with its organizer Privy Bearer token **or** a door-access-link token (`x-door-token` header). `/api/tickets/verify` is **door-gated**: it loads the event and requires `requestMayWorkTheDoor` (`src/lib/doorAccess.ts` — organizer `requestOwnsWallet` OR a valid `door_access_links` row for exactly this event) before doing anything (a valid QR alone must not let a stranger burn a ticket). Keep this gate. Door tokens unlock ONLY the door surface (verify, snapshot, redeem-offline) — never other organizer routes.
   - Verify route steps: (0) organizer auth for `eventId`, (1) replay protection — accept current or previous minute, (2) reconstruct challenge, (3) verify Ed25519 signature via `crypto.subtle`, (4) on-chain ownership check via Helius DAS, (5) atomic redemption — sets `redeemed_at` only if currently NULL, scoped to `event_id = eventId`.
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is present in env but **not used** for QR verification (legacy name, do not remove — may be referenced elsewhere).
3. **Organizer gate** – New organizers apply at `/become-organizer`. The POST handler at `/api/organizers/apply` verifies the Privy auth token server-side (`@privy-io/server-auth`), checks that the user has a verified email address on their Privy account, then inserts into the `organizers` table at `status: 'approved'`. `/dashboard` requires approved organizer status.
4. **Organizer dashboard** – `/dashboard` lets approved organizers create events (saved to Supabase) and view sales. `/api/events/create` requires a Privy Bearer token proving ownership of `organizer_wallet` (`requestOwnsWallet` in `src/lib/privyServer.ts` — use this helper for any new writing organizer route). Events can be marked **private** at creation — private events are excluded from the public listing but remain purchasable via direct link.

### Routing

| Path | Who |
|------|-----|
| `/` | Public landing page |
| `/shop/[id]` | Public event listing & purchase |
| `/become-organizer` | Organizer application (Privy auth required) |
| `/dashboard` | Organizer dashboard (approved organizer required) |
| `/my-tickets` | Buyer's ticket collection |
| `/tickets/[assetId]` | Individual ticket + QR code |
| `/doorman/[eventId]` | Camera scanner for venue staff |
| `/dashboard/events/[id]` | Organizer event detail (tickets, redemption, quick actions) |

### Authentication & wallets (Privy)

Root layout wraps everything in `PrivyProvider`. Login method is **email only** (`loginMethods: ['email']`). Email login auto-creates a Solana embedded wallet per user. All auth-gated pages check `usePrivy().authenticated` client-side. Server-side token verification uses `PrivyClient` from `@privy-io/server-auth` (requires `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`).

### Blockchain

- **Network**: decided solely by `NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_RPC_URL` via `heliusRpcUrl()` in `src/lib/solana.ts` — never hardcode an RPC host. Currently pointed at **Devnet**; the mainnet switch is an env-var change plus new trees/operator key (see backlog memory).
- **Minting**: `src/lib/mint.ts` — Metaplex Bubblegum cNFTs. The operator keypair (`OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`) signs every mint; the buyer's embedded wallet receives the cNFT as `leafOwner`. The buyer never signs — don't change this to client-side signing.
- **Merkle trees**: `MERKLE_TREE_ADDRESSES` (comma-separated; each mint picks one at random via `pickMerkleTree()` — spreads concurrent mints so tree transactions don't conflict). Legacy fallback: `MERKLE_TREE_ADDRESS`. `npm run create-tree` creates one tree on the network `NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_RPC_URL` points at (~0.1 SOL on mainnet, depth 14 = 16,384 tickets).
- **Asset queries**: Helius DAS API (`HELIUS_API_KEY`) for ownership and metadata lookups; always fetched with `cache: 'no-store'`.
- **cNFT metadata**: static per-event JSON in the public Supabase Storage bucket `event-assets` (`metadata/<eventId>.json`, written by `uploadEventMetadata` in `src/lib/eventMetadata.ts` during `/api/events/create`; `events.metadata_uri` stores the URL, `events.image_url` the optional event image uploaded via `/api/events/upload-image`). The mint uses `metadata_uri`; the legacy dynamic route `/api/tickets/metadata?name=&date=` remains as fallback for events created before it existed (their minted assets point at it on-chain — don't remove).
- **cNFT metadata attributes**: use `trait_type: "Event Name"` and `trait_type: "Event Date"` (two words, title-case). All writers (`uploadEventMetadata`, `/api/tickets/metadata`) and the reader `/tickets/[assetId]/page.tsx` must match these exact strings.

### Database (Supabase)

Tables:
- `events`: `id, organizer_wallet, name, date, price_eur, capacity, tickets_sold, tickets_reserved, is_private, payout_hold_days, image_url, metadata_uri, venue, description, cancelled_at, reminder_sent_at, created_at`
  - `reminder_sent_at` — once-only claim for the day-before reminder e-mail batch (`sendDueEventReminders` in `src/lib/reminders.ts`, runs inside the payout cron because both Hobby cron slots are taken; recipients via purchases→mint_jobs like the organizer messaging).
  - `is_private boolean default false` — private events are excluded from `/api/events/public` but still purchasable via direct link.
  - `image_url` / `metadata_uri` — public Supabase Storage URLs (bucket `event-assets`); `metadata_uri` is stamped on-chain at mint, NULL for pre-existing events (mint falls back to the legacy dynamic metadata route).
  - `payout_hold_days int default 0 (0–90)` — days after the event date before ticket revenue is transferred to the organizer (chargeback protection). 0 = transferred by the next daily payout cron.
  - `tickets_reserved int default 0` — capacity claimed by open checkout sessions. Available = `capacity - tickets_sold - tickets_reserved`. Never update `tickets_sold`/`tickets_reserved` directly from code — always go through the SQL functions `reserve_tickets`, `unreserve_tickets`, `finalize_ticket_sale`, `release_reservation`, `release_expired_reservations` (atomic, race-free).
  - `capacity` / `price_eur` are the **aggregate** over the event's tiers since 2026-07-07: capacity = sum of tier capacities, price_eur = min tier price ("ab"-price for listings). The tier is the price authority at checkout.
  - `cancelled_at` — set once via `/api/events/update` (action `cancel`): sales stop (checkout 410), event leaves the public listing, every not-yet-transferred charge is refunded in full (the `charge.refunded` webhook does revoke + seats), free-ticket purchases revoked directly, open sessions expired. Payouts in `paid`/`disputed` are reported for manual handling, not auto-refunded.
- `ticket_tiers`: price categories per event — `id, event_id, name, price_eur, capacity, tickets_sold, tickets_reserved, sort`. Every event has ≥1 tier (legacy events got a backfilled 'Standard' tier); max 5, names unique per event. Tier counters follow the same rule as event counters: only via the SQL functions (all take an optional `p_tier_id` and keep tier + event aggregate in sync; the event-level total remains the hard overselling gate). Editing: capacity can't drop below sold+reserved, tiers with sales can't be deleted.
- `ticket_reservations`: one row per checkout session — `stripe_session_id (PK), event_id, tier_id, quantity, status (reserved|finalized|released|refunded), expires_at`. State transitions happen only inside the SQL functions above.
- `mint_jobs`: async mint queue — `stripe_session_id (unique), event_id, tier_id, buyer_wallet, buyer_email, quantity, status (queued|processing|done|failed), attempts, last_error, refund_id`. Claimed via `claim_mint_jobs(limit, max_attempts)` (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED). `refund_id` is the once-only gate for the auto-refund on permanent failure. Worker: `src/lib/mintJobs.ts`.
- `purchases`: `event_id, tier_id, buyer_wallet, asset_id, stripe_session_id, redeemed_at, revoked_at` — `revoked_at` is set when the charge is fully refunded; the doorman verify route rejects revoked tickets.
- `organizers`: `id, wallet_address, email, name, type (private|business), business_name, status (approved), stripe_account_id, stripe_charges_enabled, stripe_payouts_enabled, plan (free|pro), stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, plan_period_end, plan_cancel_at_period_end, created_at`
- `badges`: buyer achievements — `id, wallet_address, badge_type, asset_id, earned_at, event_id, organizer_wallet` (partial unique indexes dedupe awards; see Badges section)
- `organizer_messages` / `loyalty_programs` / `loyalty_claims` / `analytics_events`: see Dashboard Pro & analytics sections
- `profiles`: buyer/organizer account profile — `wallet_address (PK), display_name, bio, is_private`. Edited on `/account` (GET/PUT `/api/profile`, auth `requestOwnsWallet`); read server-side by the public profile `/collection/[walletAddress]` (`is_private` hides the page, `display_name` replaces the wallet ID). `ProfileNudge` (mounted on `/my-tickets` + `/dashboard`) prompts accounts without a display name once per device; `AccountMenu` is the avatar dropdown in all signed-in topbars.
- `payouts`: one row per paid checkout session — `stripe_session_id (unique), payment_intent_id, charge_id, event_id, organizer_wallet, stripe_account_id, gross_cents, fee_cents, net_cents, currency, available_at, status (pending|paid|held|disputed|failed|refunded), transfer_id, dispute_id, failure_reason`
- `discount_codes`: Pro feature — `id, event_id, code (unique per event, case-insensitive), percent_off (1–100; 100 = guest list), max_uses (soft cap), uses, active`. Validation authority: `findValidDiscount`/`discountedUnitPrice` in `src/lib/discounts.ts`, used by BOTH `/api/checkout/validate-code` (public preview, rate-limited) and `/api/checkout/create` (`discountCode` in body scales the tier price + recomputes the service fee; metadata `discountCodeId`/`discountPercent`). Uses are incremented by the completed webhook via SQL function `increment_discount_uses` (webhook idempotency claim = dedupe). CRUD: `/api/organizer/discount-codes` (Pro-gated); DELETE deactivates.
- `waitlist_entries`: Pro feature — `id, event_id, email, notified_at, unique(event_id, email)`. Signup: `POST /api/waitlist/join` (public, rate-limited, only when sold out AND organizer plan = pro; shop page shows the form via server-side plan check). Notification (`src/lib/waitlist.ts`): `notifyWaitlistIfSeats` claims entries atomically (notified_at while NULL) and mails "wieder verfügbar" — hooked into `charge.refunded` (full refund), `checkout.session.expired`, and the daily `sweepWaitlists` in the payout cron. One mail per entry, ever; the mail reserves nothing.
- `door_access_links`: time-limited doorman access — `id, event_id, token (unique plaintext bearer), label, expires_at (event date + 2 days), revoked_at`. Managed via `/api/organizer/door-links` (GET/POST/DELETE, organizer-gated, max 10 active/event; DELETE revokes instead of deleting). Doorman opens `/doorman/[eventId]?key=<token>` without Privy login; the key is validated via the snapshot route.
- `stripe_webhook_events`: processed Stripe event IDs (`id` = evt_… primary key) — the webhook idempotency gate.

### Stripe Connect payouts

- **Model**: Separate Charges & Transfers (NOT destination charges) — rationale documented in `src/lib/payouts.ts`. The platform charges the buyer; the webhook writes a `payouts` row; `/api/cron/payouts` (Vercel Cron, daily 03:00 UTC, auth `Bearer CRON_SECRET`) transfers `net_cents` to the organizer's Express account once `available_at` has passed, using `source_transaction` and idempotency key `payout-transfer-<payout id>`.
- **Fees**: buyer-side service fee €1.00 + 4% **per ticket** (`src/lib/fees.ts` — client-safe, imported by the shop UI) added as a second Stripe line item; the organizer nets 100% of the face price. The fee total is stored in the session metadata (`serviceFeeCents`) and booked as `fee_cents` by the webhook. Sessions without that metadata (pre-fee) fall back to the legacy organizer-side 3% split (`computeFeeSplit`, `PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` — keep for legacy rows). Free tickets carry no fee. Partial refunds rescale fee/net by the payout row's own fee ratio.
- **KYC gate**: organizers can always create events; `/api/checkout/create` returns 503 for paid events until the organizer's Connect account has `charges_enabled`.
- **Failure handling**: failed transfers (restricted account etc.) → status `held`, funds stay on the platform balance. `charge.dispute.created` blocks a pending transfer (`disputed`). Admin resolution UI at `/admin/payouts` (gated by `ADMIN_SECRET`, sent as `x-admin-secret`): retry / release / cancel.
- **Webhook idempotency**: every handled event ID is claimed via PK insert into `stripe_webhook_events` before processing. On payout-row/finalize/enqueue failures the claim is released and a 500 returned so Stripe retries. Mint retries are handled by the `mint_jobs` queue, not by Stripe redelivery.
- **Refunds** (`charge.refunded`): full refund before transfer → payout `refunded` (terminal), tickets revoked (`purchases.revoked_at`), seats freed via `refund_ticket_sale`; partial refund → organizer share recomputed from the remaining amount; refund after transfer → flagged for manual recovery.
- The Stripe webhook endpoint must be subscribed to `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `account.updated`, `charge.dispute.created`, `charge.refunded`, `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted` and (Connect) `payout.paid`, `payout.failed`.

### Dashboard Pro (subscription)

- `organizers.plan ('free'|'pro')` + `stripe_customer_id/stripe_subscription_id/plan_period_end/plan_cancel_at_period_end`. **Only the Stripe webhook writes `plan`** (subscription-mode `checkout.session.completed` + `customer.subscription.*`; `active`/`trialing` → pro via `subscriptionPlanFromStatus` in `src/lib/subscription.ts` — pure, unit-tested).
- The webhook branches on `session.mode === 'subscription'` (or `metadata.purpose === 'pro_subscription'`) right after the idempotency claim — subscription sessions must NEVER fall through to the ticket path (`release_reservation`/finalize).
- Billing routes: `POST /api/organizer/billing/checkout` (creates/reuses Stripe Customer, subscription-mode Checkout), `POST /api/organizer/billing/portal` (Billing Portal; must be configured once in the Stripe dashboard). Auth: `requestOwnsWallet`.
- Pro gate for API routes: `requireProOrganizer(req, walletAddress)` in `src/lib/plan.ts` (401/403 `pro_required`); client UI reads `plan` from `/api/organizers/status` (also returns `plan_period_end`, `plan_cancel_at_period_end`).
- Pro features: `GET /api/organizer/analytics` (cross-event revenue/redemption/repeat-customer stats, top customers, conversion funnel from `analytics_events` — distinct cid per stage, matched by `/shop/<id>` path), `POST /api/organizer/message` (plaintext e-mail to all ticket holders of an event; max 2/event/24h; audit table `organizer_messages`), discount codes, waitlist, loyalty program (below). UI: `/dashboard/analytics` (upsell for free plan) + „Gäste kontaktieren" modal and Rabattcode card on the event detail page.
- **Payout transparency** (free, all organizers): `GET /api/organizer/payouts` (`requestOwnsWallet`) + `/dashboard/payouts` — pending/paid/held summary and per-sale payout list.
- **Loyalty**: `loyalty_programs` (one per organizer: threshold 2–20, benefit, active) + `loyalty_claims` (one per customer per program, unique 6-char `code`, atomic `redeemed_at`). Qualification = distinct redeemed events at the organizer (`src/lib/loyalty.ts`) — same signal as the Stammgast badge. Buyers see/claim on `/my-tickets` via `GET /api/loyalty/status` + `POST /api/loyalty/claim`; benefits are hidden at read time when the organizer's plan lapses. Organizer config/redeem via `/api/organizer/loyalty[/redeem]`.

### Badges (buyer gamification)

- Single source of truth: `src/lib/badgeMeta.ts` (client-safe — `BadgeType`, `BADGE_META`, `MILESTONES`, thresholds; `supabase.ts` re-exports `BadgeType` from it). Never duplicate badge display maps in pages.
- Types: `first_show/show_5/show_10` (redeemed-ticket milestones), `loyal_organizer` („Stammgast", 3 distinct redeemed events **per organizer**, `badges.organizer_wallet` set), `sold_out_show` (redeemed at a sold-out event) — all awarded on redemption (`checkRedemptionBadges`, called from ticket verify AND offline-redeem sync); `first_ticket`/`early_bird` (purchase ≤1h after event creation) — awarded at mint time (`checkPurchaseBadges` from `mintJobs`). All calls fire-and-forget.
- Dedupe via partial unique indexes on `badges` (wallet+type global, wallet+type+organizer for Stammgast); inserts tolerate 23505. Badge cNFT minted async (`mintBadge`), images in `public/badges/<type>.png`, metadata route `/api/badges/metadata` (German, immutable-cached).
- `/api/my-tickets` returns a `progress` object (attended count, next milestone, best Stammgast candidate by organizer display name) rendered as progress bars on `/my-tickets`.
- **Nudge-Mail**: `maybeSendBadgeNudge` (in `src/lib/badges.ts`, called at the end of `checkRedemptionBadges`) e-mails the guest after check-in when exactly 1 event remains to the Stammgast badge or the next milestone; only on the wallet's first redeemed ticket at that event (guards against multi-ticket re-sends). Best-effort — never fails the redemption path.
- **Public profile share card**: `/collection/[walletAddress]/opengraph-image.tsx` renders the OG image (name, attended count, badge symbols); private profiles get a generic card. `generateMetadata` on the page supplies title/description; `ShareButton` (client) does navigator.share/clipboard.

### First-party analytics (consent-gated)

- Cookies `passly_consent` (`granted|denied`, 12 months) + `passly_cid` (UUID, only while granted) — set client-side by `ConsentBanner` (`src/app/components/ConsentBanner.tsx`, mounted in the root layout with `PageViewTracker`). `track()` in `src/lib/track.ts` is a no-op without consent.
- `POST /api/track` requires both cookies, enforces an event-name allowlist (`page_view`, `checkout_started`, `purchase_completed`, `ticket_viewed`), caps props at 1 KB, always answers 204. Table `analytics_events` (no wallets/e-mails/IPs — `cid` is the only identifier).
- `/datenschutz` Ziffer 10 documents the cookie + withdrawal (`ConsentSettingsButton`); the page and any tracking change MUST ship in the same deploy. Doorman pages are never tracked.
- **Alerting**: operational failures e-mail `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` via `sendAdminAlert` (src/lib/email.ts) — held transfers (payout cron), refund-after-transfer, dispute created, refund/payout-row webhook failures, Connect bank-payout failures, unresolved refunds on event cancellation, permanently failed mint jobs. Always fire-and-forget (`void …().catch(…)`), never block the money path on Resend.

### Doorman offline buffer

`/doorman/[eventId]` keeps admitting guests without connectivity: while online it refreshes a ticket snapshot every 60 s (`/api/organizer/event/snapshot`, cached in localStorage). When the live verify call fails (5 s timeout), verification runs locally (`src/app/doorman/[eventId]/offline.ts`): same Ed25519 challenge + minute window as the server, ownership against `purchases.buyer_wallet` (kept current by claims), once-only redemption against snapshot + local queue. Queued offline scans sync via `/api/tickets/redeem-offline` (atomic redeem; conflicts reported when another device was first). Known trade-off: two offline devices can't see each other's scans.

### Support

- `/hilfe` — public FAQ + support address (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, default support@getpassly.de), linked from all footers.
- **Ticket re-issue** (buyer lost e-mail access): verify identity out-of-band (Stripe receipt), then `POST /api/admin/reissue` (`x-admin-secret`, body `{"assetId"}`) → returns a one-time claim link for the buyer's new account. Uses the existing claims/escrow flow; blocked for redeemed/revoked tickets.

**Security model** — intentional, don't change:
- All Supabase reads/writes go through the service-role admin client (bypasses RLS).
- **RLS is enabled on every table** (since 2026-07-05). The only anon policy is SELECT on non-private `events`. New tables must enable RLS in their migration. The exported `supabasePublic` anon client is currently unused by the app.
- **Any route keyed by a `walletAddress`/`buyerWallet`/`ownerWallet` param that returns personal data must gate on `requestOwnsWallet`** — a wallet address is public, so the param alone proves nothing. This covers reads too, not just writes (`/api/my-tickets`, `/api/loyalty/status`, `/api/tickets/events`, `/api/profile`). The public profile at `/collection/[wallet]` is the deliberate exception and self-censors via `profiles.is_private`.
- **Best-effort rate limiting** via `src/lib/rateLimit.ts` (in-memory, per warm instance) guards the abuse-prone unauthenticated/entry routes: `/api/checkout/create` (reservation exhaustion), `/api/claims/create`, `/api/organizers/apply`, `/api/track`. Not a hard global quota — back with Redis if a stricter limit is ever needed.

### Conventions

- **Design system ("Tokn Based" light template, fully migrated 2026-07-06)**: light theme, violet accent via `--hue: 285`, Geist fonts. Design tokens (`--ink*/--surface*/--accent*`, radii, shadows) **and** the shared component CSS (`.topbar`, `.card`, `.btn`, `.chip`, `.event-card`, `.modal`, `.drawer`, `.field/.input`, `.aurora`, utilities …) live in `src/app/globals.css`. `Icon` (stroke icon set) and `Spark` (sparkline) live in `src/app/components/passlyUi.tsx`. Page archetypes: app pages = `.app > .topbar > .main > .aurora + .container` with `.hero`; mobile pages (ticket, doorman, shop, claim, success) = centered card on `radial-gradient(1000px 500px at 50% -10%, var(--accent-wash), transparent 60%), var(--surface-2)`.
- **Language**: all user-facing copy is **German** (getpassly.de), du-Form. No crypto/web3/Solana wording anywhere in the UI — framing is "fälschungssicher"; say "Konto"/"Ticket" instead of wallet/NFT.
- **Styling**: page-specific styles go in inline `<style>{`...`}</style>` blocks referencing the global tokens/classes. Don't introduce Tailwind utility classes on new pages.
- **Fonts**: Geist + Geist Mono loaded once in the root layout (`--font-geist`, `--font-geist-mono`, referenced as `--font`/`--mono`). No other fonts.
- **Client vs server**: Most pages are `'use client'` because of Privy hooks. Server components are limited to `/`, `/events`, `/shop/[id]/page.tsx`, `/tickets/[assetId]/page.tsx`, `/collection/[walletAddress]` (data fetching) and all `/api/*` routes.
- **Stack versions**: Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind 4 (PostCSS only, no config file). Don't suggest patterns that assume older versions.
